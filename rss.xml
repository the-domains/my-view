            <title><![CDATA[Discovering Stoic Philosophy]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Discovering Stoic Philosophy</h1><p>My introduction to stoicism was unlike most I've heard of. I never studied philosophy in school, spent time with philosophers, nor cared for it in the first place. I heard names of writers and their books; of philosophers and their thoughts, but always viewed them as too difficult to understand, or not worth understanding. I was a fool.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7cdd3c2f-b1e7-42bd-a196-b22e4824afbc.png"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[But what does this really mean? It
means finding the silver lining no matter what happens. Understand: hiding from
the burdens you bear will not make them go away, seeing them in a way that
helps you, instead of hinders you, is the solution. This is how Demosthenes, a
frail boy, with a stutter, quiet as a mouse, can become one of the greatest
orators in history. It is how a man is kicked out of his own company can change
the world and start a movement of "start-ups" and would-be
entrepreneurs. This is how a man, bullied as a child for being different can
use his differences to become a dominant force in developing new technologies,
leading humanity into space, and reminding us that relying on computers will
one day bring its own burdens. It is how a young woman with no prospects, no
money, little if any connections, can go from stealing out of necessity, to
creating a massive clothing company worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
