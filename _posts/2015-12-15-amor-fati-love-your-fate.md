# Amor Fati - Love Your Fate
null

The time it took to finally understand this concept (or at least believe that I now understand it) has been tremendous. To love your fate might sometimes seem like a Herculean, but it is not. There is always a better way of seeing the events in your life, and using your mindset to thrive not in avoidance of these obstacles, but _because_ of them. 

Things happen, they are neutral. It is your mindset that determines the impact things have on your life. The right perspective has a strange way of destroying obstacles and creating opportunities. By changing the way you look at things, the things you look at will also change. Focus on the negatives, and you will find them. Focus on the opportunities, and perhaps, you may find the actions to advance.
