# Discovering Stoic Philosophy

My introduction to stoicism was unlike most I've heard of. I never studied philosophy in school, spent time with philosophers, nor cared for it in the first place. I heard names of writers and their books; of philosophers and their thoughts, but always viewed them as too difficult to understand, or not worth understanding. I was a fool.

In time, I learned about The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius; the tome of stoic philosophy. A published compilation of the thoughts, feelings, and insights of a Roman Emperor in his own words, written originally, for none other than himself.  My introduction was sudden, exciting, and has shaped my mind in new, wonderful ways. I can never explain how thankful I am for this introduction.

Like I said, I didn't learn about stoicism from the essential book on the subject, written by the last philosopher king. Instead, I learned about it from what I call a modern version/homage. I'm talking about a little book entitled "The Obstacle is the Way" by  Ryan Holiday, who I've become a dear fan of since reading. 

It has introduced me to a world I wish I had discovered sooner. Now, despite learning about it later in my life, I will make up for lost time by devoting myself to understanding as much as I can, as an aspiring stoic (if there can be such a thing). When I knew I would devote myself to learning, the first thing I realized is that I must act on what I learn. No matter what may be suggested, all the insights in the world are useless if they are not followed with the right actions. 

This is one of the many reasons I've grown to love stoicism. It's practical. My hope is to share the journey of applying what I learn, so others can come to love this practical philosophy the way I do. I am no stoic, and the obstacles are many; so, instead of listing how my current mindset will bring me burdens, I will end this post with a quote from the philosopher king himself. I first read this in "The Obstacle is the Way," and it has stuck with me since my wonderful introduction to stoic philosophy. 

"Our actions may be impeded, but there can be no impeding our intentions or our dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way." - Marcus Aurelius
